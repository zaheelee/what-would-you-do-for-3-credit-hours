A choose your own adventure game about the lows a college student would sink to just to pass their Intro to Photography class.

This game was made using Twine2. All of the HTML was generated by Twine2, and the story, choices, gameplay, and styling were all 
written by me.

Thank you so much for playing, and I hope you have fun!
